A Project built on MVC architecture that allows users to write their reviews and provide their analysis of the movies they watch.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  JavaScript | Node.js | Express.js | MongoDB | Bootstrap | HTML5 | CSS3 

Users can search for a movie of their choice via external TMDB API and give their rating/review of the movie. I made use of passport authentication, so the ratings are specific to the users. The user's information along with their reviews are stored in the MongoDB. The application makes use of the templating engine ejs to render the HTML. The users can delete the reviews, or star/unstar them so the starred ones stay at the top. The web application is made fully responsive. 

## Optimizations

Some of the optimizations that can be made: 

- Add a movie board feature where everyone's reviews can be shown, and have the ability to like other people's reviews, which increases user engagement and provide a sense of community among users.  
- Add your own title and movie poster along with reviews, instead of using the external API for a broader choice of movies to choose from.
- Edit your reviews to make a change, for a better user experience. 

## Lessons Learned:

- I honed my skill of using an MVC architecture on a full-stack app. Separating the application into modules allowed me to improve code organization and add another layer of maintainability. 
- I also utilized passport authentication in the application to limit malicious users to try to access the parts of the app, adding another layer of security to the users.
